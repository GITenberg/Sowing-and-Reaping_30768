description: You've probably heard, ""You reap what you sow!"" A truth from God's
  Word, we certainly see the effects of our work and day-to-day choices, whether positive
  or negative. Through Moody's stories and illustrations, we see the outcome of deceiving
  in and the reward of a wise, righteous life. Be challenged as you reflect on your
  own life-What are you sowing?
